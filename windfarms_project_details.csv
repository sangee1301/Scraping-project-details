Comments,"The Danish Energy Agency (DEA) believes that elements, such as Siemens' innovative gravity-jacket foundation concept, tested at Nissum Bredning Vind will bring significant savings in regards to both construction and operating costs. Siemens' SWT-7.0-154 turbines will be connected by 66kV cables, expected to become the industry standard, which will result in lower losses during transmission. Further material savings will be provided by the slender tower concept, where Siemens will implement a new lightweight turbine tower especially suited for jacket foundations.Full list of 8 development, demonstration and test elements: 1) 0-series test of SWP-7.0-154 WTGs2) Prototype type test of SWP Gravity Foundation3) Prototype of Slender Tower Concept4) Prototype test of cables in Pipe (CIP)5) 66kV (72kV) cables and switchgear solution6) Test of LIDAR power curve measurement7) Synchronization of rotors - Visual appearance8) Optimized use of sensors and limitation of loads through reduced output from the WTG",

In March 2012, the government agreed to another 1GW of offshore power by 2020.A draft of the prequalification was released in October 2013 it was stated that only 6 applications will be supported and that applicants must have had experience in project development and management of construction. The closing date for any comments on this was 23/10/2013.At the beginning of May 2014, it was announced that the Danish Energy Agency (DEA) had prequalified four developers for the tender of the Horns Rev 3 site: Statoil, E.ON, Vattenfall and DONG Energy.

Comments,"As with open door projects, generators are to pay for the grid connection to shore. Costs of environmental and geotech studies, estimated at 10-15m kr will be initially borne by Energinet.dk through a network tariff. The costs for the preliminary investigations in the area won by the concessionaire will subsequently be refunded by the concessionaire.The nearshore tender is seen as a way of increasing competition for site development in Denmark - the smaller scale and relatively easier construction environment should make sites more interesting for developers.Constructors are obliged to offer 20% of projects to local citizens. Constructors who can demonstrate that at least 30% of the project is locally owned by enterprises and citizens will get a price supplement of DKK 0.01/kWh.Energinet.dk, who is responsible for conducting the preliminary surveys and the EIA, has made available their cost projection for this. The cost of the surveys at any site is to be paid by the concession winner of the site. Only the costs of those sites which will be used in this round, are to be paid.The final costs will be published in the fall of 2015. Vesterhavet Syd cost projection for these activities is 23.8 mll DKK or 3.2 mill Euro.",

Comments,"As with open door projects, generators are to pay for the grid connection to shore. Costs of environmental and geotech studies, estimated at 10-15m kr will be initially borne by Energinet.dk through a network tariff. The costs for the preliminary investigations in the area won by the concessionaire will subsequently be refunded by the concessionaire.The nearshore tender is seen as a way of increasing competition for site development in Denmark - the smaller scale and relatively easier construction environment should make sites more interesting for developers.Constructors are obliged to offer 20% of projects to local citizens. Constructors who can demonstrate that at least 30% of the project is locally owned by enterprises and citizens will get a price supplement of DKK 0.01/kWh.Total turbine height 135-220m. Max number of turbines is 67 if the capacity is 200MW and the turbines are 3MW.Energinet.dk, who is responsible for conducting the preliminary surveys and the EIA, has made available their cost projection for this. The cost of the surveys at any site is to be paid by the concession winner of the site. Only the costs of those sites which will be used in this round, are to be paid.The final costs will be published in the fall of 2015. The cost projection for this project is 23.3 mill DKK or 3.13 mill Euro.Update 2014: As part of the Growth Pack 2014 (Vækstpakke 2014) proposals the overall capacity for this nearshore round was reduced from 450MW to 350MW. There was also a cap put on future bids of 0.70DKK per kWh for 50,000 full load hours. Relevant offers above this cap will be subject to political acceptance. The 50MW pilot projects were unaffected.Update March 2015: A multisite tender will be issued. This means that 6 areas will be offered for tender at the same time and that projects within these sites will be competing against each other. The concession owner shall build and operate the wind farm and the export cable to the grid connection point on the shore. A tenderer is allowed to submit more than 1 tender. Furthermore,conditional tendering for 2 sites will be possible, i.e. a tenderer can submit offers for up to 350 MW conditional upon the tenderer being awarded concession for both sites.The DEA will award the concession(s) to the tenderer(s) who has submitted the offer(s) which make(s) it possible to obtain establishment of the highest total capacity within the maximum limit of 350 MW at the lowest total average price. The license and authorisation for operations will be given for 25 years with the possibility of prolongation if allowed under applicable law. The concession agreement(s) offer(s) a fixed price/kWh for 50 000 full load hours (contract for difference) which makes a very predictable income. The fixed price will not be indexed.Following pre-qualification the DEA will invite a maximum of 10 applicants.In order to ensure that only genuine, professional tenderes submit tenders, the DEA is introducing a penalty for defective performance of 100 000 000 DKK (EUR ~13.5m). The required guarantee will be released when a capex of DKK 300m has been spent or the first kWh has been delivered.At least 20% ownership shares must be made available to local citizens.Full compensation forloss of local residential value where greater than 1 per cent must be paid.The concession agreements are subject to i) the Danish Parliament adopting the necessary amendment to the RE Act to accept the winning price and ii) EU state aid clearance",

Comments,"The Frederikshavn Offshore Wind Demo will focus on innovations with foundations and cables and its installation and operation and maintenance and looked the progress under the 50MW pilot subsidy scheme outlined by the Danish Energy Agency.Nissum Bredning was announced winner of the Danish Energy Agency's pilot project scheme to support new technology, meaning that Frederikshavn was not initially successful. Nissum Bredning accounted for 28MW of the total 50MW: it currently remains unclear whether the remaining 22MW will be tendered, although confirmation either way will arise soon according to direct communication with the Danish Energy Agency. If another award round is agreed, Frederikshavn will be required to downsize to fit within the 50MW ceiling cap.",

Comments,"The use of concrete in the lower portion of the spar lowers the centre of gravity, can reduce the cost and allows local production. The 2MW foundation design has a diameter of 7.8m, draft of 76m and is ballasted by 30t of seawater. Weight of turbine and spar is 3400t. Catenary mooring is realised through three 450m long and 132mm diameter steel chains with three high-grasping drag-embedded anchors. The spar is designed for wind-speeds of 48.3m/s and significant wave heights of 7.73m (14.4m actual) . Although the facility is connected to Kyushu Electric Power Co.’s power grid through a subsea cable, the cable is too small to transmit all the electricity the wind turbine is able to generate. Currently, the power plant sends just 30 percent of its produced electricity to the power grid.",

Once testing had been completed decision taken to install turbine off of Fukue Island for commercial operation. Prior to installation, an export cable was installed that allows all generated electricity to be exported to shore. Whilst at previous location only 35% of full capacity could be exported, due to 600kW cable.",

It is understood construction team for Tamra project  is already set up and  waiting to start work.December 2016 - Developer claims that complaints, not the construction technology or the environment, as being the greatest difficulty of the  project. The initial  of the project was to be  KRW 150 billion, and the final cost being KRW 165 billion. This is due to compensation costs being higher than expected.The  10 wind turbines  were to be installed in parallel at 275m intervals, but one turbine had to be installed 50m from planned location, due to a fixed fishing net occupying planned position,with owner being unwilling negotiate .",

Storage capacity at load-out harbour Bremerhaven has been secured for 6 months where the foundations can be directly loaded onto the installation vessel.In reality, troubles were had concerning limited space at both the factory in Norway and in Bremerhaven for an extended period of time; the jackets were stored on barges for as long as possible.RWE also agreed a twelve month storage contract for the array cable at its manufacturing yard in Sweden, and faced challenges when this contract expired yet were not ready to install the cable. The 63km of delicate subsea cable was moved to Landskrona for temporary storage.",

Comments,"It is expected the wind farm was downsized to 288MW because of the remaining connection capacity left in the SylWin1 converter station (exactly 288MW).Previously the site was expected to comprise of 96 turbines: 80 x 3.6MW in the large geographical section to the north and 16 x 4MW in the smaller east-west slither to the south - the area known as Nördlicher Grund (not to be confused with a different project of the same name). It is worth noting that the Nördlicher Grund slither is not now expected to be developed. Before this announcement, Sandbank obtained consent for 96 turbines to a maximum output of 576MW.Consequently the project is expandable and according to Vattenfall could reach a maximum capacity of approximately 500 megawatts. 64 additional turbine locations are available, of which 24 (including all of the southern slither) have already been approved.",

The GICON® SOF is deployable in water depths from 20 (depending on the site conditions and turbine size) to 350 meters (700m under development, early pre-design).. It is towable, allowing the SOF with turbine to be towed to location, without the need for special installation vessels.  Compared to other floating foundation technologies, the GICON® SOF is the only solution with stability comparable to conventional offshore foundations; there is no pitch and toss which would create additional demands on the turbine.",

It is thought that the project has been downsized to 270MW, consisting of 45 6MW turbines (therefore it is also believed that the contract with Areva for 5MW turbines has expired since the ownership of the wind farm changed hands).CAPEX cost applies for when the project was previously planned to be 400MW.Both Borkum Riffgrund West I and Borkum Riffgrund West II will be treated as the same project during tendering and construction.",

Comments,"Two Towers BV (a consortium of Van Oord Renewable Finance, Investri Offshore and Green Giraffe Holding) announced as winner of the tender for the Borssele V innovation site on 6th April 2018. The wind farm will be used to demonstrate new technologies. Two Towers intends to  implement an innovative 'split joint' clamping connection solution between the foundation and tower. This technology, developed in collaboration with Van Oord, has two major advantages: it is maintenance-free and it reduces installation time. The consortium will also use innovative aluminium-based protection which ensures a higher life expectancy of the mast and requires less maintenance will be tested. In addition, Two Towers willbuild oyster beds which will prevent erosion of the soil around the foundations of the turbines and help the restoration of the marine ecosystem in the North Sea. Site V is located in the area that was investigated as Site III.Objectives are to demonstrate new technologies at a high Technology-Readiness Levels (TRL8)• Enabling cost reduction• Enhancing the market and export potential• Increasing knowledge by combining demonstration and (small) R&D",

Comments,"At the end of 2012 the coalition committed to undertaking a feasibility study for developing offshore wind within the 12nm territorial sea, with the aim of identifying more economic locations. The two-phase study started with a spatial investigation of potential locations after accounting for constraints relating to ports, shipping routes, sediments and environmentally sensitive areas. Also considered were cost and grid connection opportunities. Five potential 12nm search areas were identified (see map) which were then cost modeled against locations within the EEZ. The study estimated that EUR 600m in subsidy savings were possible under assumptions of 2020 targets of 6GW. Next steps include more detailed spatial screening and cost modeling plus consultation before deciding whether development within the 12nm area can form part of the government’s ‘Structural Vision for Offshore Wind Energy’.",

Comments,"1:50 scale prototype of the turbine that will be 10MW. The structure gathers in seawater when it is rotating in the wind. When the wind stops the seawater is transferred from the structure back to the centre, spinning the turbine and producing energy even when the wind has stopped blowing. Previous prototypes have been tested in tanks at Gothenburg University in 2007 and a 4m tall prototype was installed in a lake in Smaland, Sweden to test the water as a roller concept.",

Comments,"100m 1MW prototype of the planned 10MW 300m turbine. The structure gathers in seawater when it is rotating in the wind. When the wind stops the seawater is transferred from the structure back to the centre, spinning the turbine and producing energy even when the wind has stopped blowing. Previous prototypes have been tested in tanks at Gothenburg University in 2007 and a 4m tall prototype was installed in a lake in Smaland, Sweden to test the water as a roller concept.",

Comments,"Consented in February 2012, the Hunterston Offshore Wind Turbine Test facility, located in North Ayrshire, was the UK’s first onshore test site for offshore wind turbines.  The project has support from Scottish Enterprise. Construction works commenced in March 2013.The site features: Siemens 6MW direct drive turbine (tip height of 177m with a rotor diameter of 154m) and a Mitsubishi 7MW Sea Angel turbine (tip height of 193.5m with a rotor diameter of 167m). During the existing testing period the facility has allowed Siemens to use the 6MW test machine to refine their 7MW turbine. Mitsubishi testing has included the Artemis hydraulic system.  In June 2018 it was announced that the test facility would be decommissioned with works beginning late summer 2018.",

Comments,"The principal objectives of the 5x6MW pilot are to verify the new up-scaled design, the reliability and availability of multiple turbines, and to cultivate a supply chain, thereby demonstrating the viability of a future commercial scale park. FID was made in 2015 and the project will be commissioned in Q4 2017. The new upscaled design shows a 17% reduction in weight (1917t/MW versus 2304t/MW) and 25m draught reduction from 100m to 75m compensated for by an increased diameter of the spar, an important fabrication challenge brought about by the new design. The maximum life of the park is 25 Years.Average wind speed = 10.1 m/s",

Comments,"The maximum number of turbines was reduced from 195 to mitigate visual impacts.E.ON has opted for ""Generator Build"" option for the offshore transmission assets. E.ON will employ a multicontract approach rather than turnkey/EPC.  Approx 20 ‘main’ Tier 1 contracts, but in practice could be 200+ other ancillary contracts over course of the project construction and operation. July 2014 The Crown Estate invited all Round 3 developers to revise the terms of their agreement as the projects transition from zone appraisals to project development. This could mean that zone development agreements are replaced with project specific contractural agreements.Rampion will be part of Ofgem's Tender Round 5, expected to launch later in 2016, with regards to the sale of its offshore transmission assets once constructed.",

Region,"Scotland, Aberdeenshire",
Comments,"November 2017 - KOWL  intend to install up to seven turbines, including a 2MW turbine that will be installed first, followed by six larger turbines over the remainder of the installation period up to 2020. The current proposed turbines would have a rated capacity of up to 8.4MW; however, the maximum generating capacity of windfarm will remain up to 50MW.The installation of the 2MW turbine in 2018 will allow for the all bird monitoring equipment to be installed for approximately 12 to 18 months to gather on-site bird collision data before the remaining larger turbines are installed.  For the installation of the 2MW turbine the semi-submersible WindFloat™ prototype from the demonstrator site in Portugal(4C Offshore ref:PT01) will be utilised. The initial period sought for such certification / verification / suitable agreed alternative of the WTG platform substructure for Turbine 1 (2MW) will be limited (expected to be three years or less). This is due to the engineering life of the substructure (ten years from initial substructure construction in 2011). At the expiry of the WTG platform substructure certification, Turbine 1 will only be re-deployed if (i) the platform structure is recertified following inspection (and only for so long as valid certification is in place) and (ii) if Marine Scotland  (in consultation with SNH, Historic Environment Scotland, Aberdeen City Council and Aberdeenshire Council) is satisfied that the re-deployment at the proposed location within the Site would not give rise to new or materially different likely significant effects to those identified in the seascape, landscape and visual assessment of the Variation Environmental Statement .",

The research will provide informmichigan offshore wind pilot projectation for the future development of offshore wind energy technology. The project is a significant partnership between MAREC and the University of Michigan’s Phoenix Energy Institute that flows from participation by both organizations on the Great Lakes Offshore Wind Council (GLOW) established by Governor Jennifer Granholm in late 2008.  In May of 2009 the project secured a $1.4 million grant from the U.S. DOE that was added to in early 2009 with a $1.3 million energy efficiency grant from the Michigan Public Service Commission. Subsequent funding needed to complete the project was provided by We Energies and the Sierra Club.",

Comments,"The project will test the feasibility of the Titan 200 Platform. The platform is available for testing of models in the range 3.6-7MW.The Titan is an offshore jack up platform composed of a unique “Y” shaped hull with a diameter slightly smaller than the wind turbine’s rotor, standing on three legs with a lifting system.  Known as a Dutch Tri-floater design, the platform cannot overturn – if any one arm begins to dip into the water, the other two arms push down to bring it back to horizontal.Three contracted revenue streams are envisioned – potable water to local water districts and enriched brine and chemical feed stock to the agricultural, pharmaceutical, chemical, and general industry as well as electrical power to the grid. Initial investigation and modelling indicates these revenue flows combined with sale of surplus power on the merchant market at prevailing rates can produce attractive equity returns.",

Comments,"One of three sites  selected as an ""Ocean Energy Test Area"", out of an original seven areas. Site is within state of Maine waters. State law allows placement of three wind turbines for a maximum of seven years. Although the capacity is 12MW the application is for 25MW. Usage is limited to a maximum of 2 wind turbines, 3 meteorological towers per wind turbine, one submerged utility line with up to 25 MW capacity, up to 2 wave energy converters, and an ocean sensor package.  The power will go into Monhegan Power District's electricity grid and Central Maine Power Co.'s electricity grid respectively. 300kV of the power will go to Monhegan Island which has high energy costs, with the remainder exported to the mainland.Maine Aqua Ventus plan to install a pilot two 6-megawatt direct-drive turbines on concrete semi-submersible foundations. These concrete foundations could result in improvements in commercial-scale production and provide offshore wind projects with a cost-effective alternative to traditional steel foundations.Electricity has been priced at $230/MWh for 20 years. This is in comparison to $270/MWh that Statoil was proposing for its Hywind project.",

Deepwater Wind will now enter negotiations with National Grid, which will submit a proposed contract to the Public Utilities Commission for regulatory review. On 13th June 2018 Conneticut also selected Revolution wind to supply 200MW of offshore wind capacity in resposne to the RFP issued in April 2018. Deepwater Wind has signed an agreement with the Conservation Law Foundation (CLF), Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and National Wildlife Federation (NWF) for additional protections for North Atlantic right whales during pre-construction activities. This includes avoiding all noise producing activities during specific parts of spring and reduced speed limit for all vessels.",

Comments,"The proposed project is a 100-150 MW floating offshore wind farm planned to be located more than 20 miles off the coast of Eureka and use Principle Power Inc's WindFloat technology. In the 'Potential Offshore Wind Energy Areas in California: An Assessment of Locations, Technology, and Costs',  possible offshore wind energy locations in the state of California are examined, reference areas and potential wind plant technologies are selected, and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) between 2015 and 2030 is analyzed. By studying representative technology located at reference wind energy areas, cost and performance characteristics were evaluated. Reference areas were identified as sites that are suitable to represent actual offshore wind projects based on physical site conditions, wind resource quality, known existing site use, and proximity to necessary infrastructure. The intent is to assist decision-making by state utilities, independent system operators, state government officials and policy makers, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, and its key stakeholders. The report is not intended to serve as a prescreening exercise for possible future offshore wind development.",

On 2nd October 2017, New York State submitted an identified Area for Consideration to the federal government’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). This comes after rigorous fieldwork, analysis, and stakeholder outreach regarding appropriate locations for wind installations off New York State’s Atlantic Coast. The State submitted extensive information supporting the Area for Consideration, which the State views as best suited for future offshore wind development.New York State requests that within this Area of Consideration, BOEM identify and lease at least four new Wind Energy Areas, each capable of supporting at least 800 megawatts. BOEM’s identification and leasing of these Wind Energy Areas will encourage competition among offshore wind developers, help reduce costs, and support New York in meeting its commitment of 2,400 megawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, enough to power 1.2 million New York State households.As part of its Master Plan process, New York began with over 16,000 square miles of area called the Offshore Study Area.

Comments,"New York State’s offshore wind energy goal is to develop 2,400 megawatts (MW) by 2030. On 2nd October 2017, New York State submitted an identified Area for Consideration to the federal government’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). This comes after rigorous fieldwork, analysis, and stakeholder outreach regarding appropriate locations for wind installations off New York State’s Atlantic Coast. The State submitted extensive information supporting the Area for Consideration, which the State views as best suited for future offshore wind development.New York State requests that within this Area of Consideration, BOEM identify and lease at least four new Wind Energy Areas, each capable of supporting at least 800 megawatts. BOEM’s identification and leasing of these Wind Energy Areas will encourage competition among offshore wind developers, help reduce costs, and support New York in meeting its commitment of 2,400 megawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, enough to power 1.2 million New York State households.As part of its Master Plan process, New York began with over 16,000 square miles of area called the Offshore Study Area. The Area for Consideration represents approximately ten percent of the original Offshore Study Area, refined through a comprehensive process based on available data and guided by stakeholder feedback, aiming to maximize benefits and minimize conflicts to ocean users, including both people and wildlife, and was developed following interagency deliberation within New York State.",

Comments,"Seawind and Olav Olsen have entered into a strategic alliance to build a first Demonstrator in 2018 of the Seawind 2-bladed turbine using an innovative Olav Olsen gravity based support structure.Seawind uses concrete foundations with steel towers. The gravity foundation used for the demonstrator, engineered by Dr. Olav Olsen SA (Norway) for water depths of between 40 and 90 metres. The concrete support structure is made at the pier, then completed with a nacelle and rotor at the pier. The entire system is towed out to the site and installed in a single operation.  The concrete foundation provides enough buoyancy to transport and install the floating system through ballasting and sinking.",

Comments,"NVE has divided the considered zones into three categories-Category A: Wind power development within the zone is technically and economically feasible, and will have relatively few negative impacts. Grid connection is possible before 2025. Category B: Wind power development within the zone will have challenges related to either technical aspects or conflict of interests/negative impacts. The challenges might be resolved in the future through technology development, grid measures and/or mitigation measures. NVE considers that zones in this category can be opened when technology matures, or when existing use of the areas changes. Category C: Wind power development within the zone represents greater challenges than in the other two categories. Conflicts of interest in the areas are not easily resolved. Foreseen negative impacts are still considered acceptable. Zones in this category should not be opened at the expense of zones in the two other categories.",

Comments,"After a strategic impact assessment this is one of 8 areas that would be considered only if all of the conditions allowed.NVE has divided the considered zones into three categories:Category A: Wind power development within the zone is technically and economically feasible, and will have relatively few negative impacts. Grid connection is possible before 2025. Category B: Wind power development within the zone will have challenges related to either technical aspects or conflict of interests/negative impacts. The challenges might be resolved in the future through technology development, grid measures and/or mitigation measures. NVE considers that zones in this category can be opened when technology matures, or when existing use of the areas changes. Category C: Wind power development within the zone represents greater challenges than in the other two categories. Conflicts of interest in the areas are not easily resolved. Foreseen negative impacts are still considered acceptable. Zones in this category should not be opened at the expense of zones in the two other categories.",

Comments,"This area was found to be unsuitable for an offshore wind farm in terms of technical-economic and environmental factors.NVE has divided the considered zones into three categories:Category A: Wind power development within the zone is technically and economically feasible, and will have relatively few negative impacts. Grid connection is possible before 2025. Category B: Wind power development within the zone will have challenges related to either technical aspects or conflict of interests/negative impacts. The challenges might be resolved in the future through technology development, grid measures and/or mitigation measures. NVE considers that zones in this category can be opened when technology matures, or when existing use of the areas changes. Category C: Wind power development within the zone represents greater challenges than in the other two categories. Conflicts of interest in the areas are not easily resolved. Foreseen negative impacts are still considered acceptable. Zones in this category should not be opened at the expense of zones in the two other categories.",

Comments,"This area was found to be unsuitable for an offshore wind farm in terms of technical-economic and environmental factors.NVE has divided the considered zones into three categories:Category A: Wind power development within the zone is technically and economically feasible, and will have relatively few negative impacts. Grid connection is possible before 2025. Category B: Wind power development within the zone will have challenges related to either technical aspects or conflict of interests/negative impacts. The challenges might be resolved in the future through technology development, grid measures and/or mitigation measures. NVE considers that zones in this category can be opened when technology matures, or when existing use of the areas changes. Category C: Wind power development within the zone represents greater challenges than in the other two categories. Conflicts of interest in the areas are not easily resolved. Foreseen negative impacts are still considered acceptable. Zones in this category should not be opened at the expense of zones in the two other categories.",
